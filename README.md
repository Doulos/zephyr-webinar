## Using Percepio Tracealyzer<sup>:registered:</sup> with NXP MCX N947
*Quae Sunt Caesaris, Caesaris* - Most of the information given here can be found in the excellent [Zephyr Project Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/index.html).

### Enabling Percepio TraceRecorder
Add the following options to your application `prj.conf`:
```kconfig
CONFIG_TRACING=y
CONFIG_PERCEPIO_TRACERECORDER=y
CONFIG_PERCEPIO_TRC_START_MODE_START_FROM_HOST=y
CONFIG_PERCEPIO_TRC_CFG_STREAM_PORT_RTT=y
CONFIG_PERCEPIO_TRC_CFG_STREAM_PORT_RTT_UP_BUFFER_SIZE=5120
```
Build your application for the MCX N947:
```console
west build -p -b frdm_mcxn947/mcxn947/cpu0 myapp
```

### Enabling Onboard Segger RTT
Per default, the MCX N947 uses the MCU-link firmware "LinkServer". The onboard debug circuit can be updated with the Segger J-Link as follows:

1. Shorten Jumper J21 to put the board to the DFU ("Device Firmware Update") mode.

2. Connect the board to your developer machine using USB
3. Run the `program_JLINK` found in the `scripts/` where the MCU-Link Debug host tools have been installed (default in `/usr/local/MCU-LINK_installer`):
```console
loic@Zephyr-MCX:/usr/local/MCU-LINK_installer/scripts$ ls
program_CMSIS  program_JLINK
```
4. Unplug the board and remove the DFU jumper.
5. Reconnect the board to your development machine. This time, the board should appear as a J-Link device:
```dmesg
[ 2173.454727] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[ 2173.454731] usb 1-2: Product: J-Link
[ 2173.454734] usb 1-2: Manufacturer: SEGGER
[ 2173.454736] usb 1-2: SerialNumber: 001069838549
[ 2173.492666] cdc_acm 1-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
[ 2173.492717] usbcore: registered new interface driver cdc_acm
[ 2173.492718] cdc_acm: USB Abstract Control Model driver for USB modems and ISDN adapters
```
### Flash your Application
You will need to install the [J-Link debug Host Tools](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack).

Per default `west flash` will use the *LinkServer* runner. You can use the **-r jlink** option to tell west to flash using J-Link:
```console
west flash -r jlink
```

### Configuring  Percepio Tracealyzer
Unfortunately, the RTT control block address auto-detection doesn't work with this SoC. This needs to be set manually in the PSF streaming settings. The address can be found by looking at the `_SEGGER_RTT` symbol in the zephyr map file:
```console
$ grep "_SEGGER_RTT" build/zephyr/zephyr.map
 .bss._SEGGER_RTT
                0x000000003000297c                _SEGGER_RTT
```

Configure the recording settings as follows:
*  **J-Link Settings**:
   - Debugger: select your J-Link probe
   - JLink speed: 4000
   - Debugger Interace: SWD
   - Target Device: MCXN947_M33_0
* **PSF streaming**:
   - Target Connection: SEGGER RTT
   - RTT Block Start Address: (address of symbol `_SEGGER_RTT`)


## Going Further

### ðŸ“š Training
Zephyr is a modular, highly portable, real-time operating system with an associated ecosystem to build secure, connected, and future-proofed devices. Zephyr is not just another RTOS but a complete development platform. It can help you achieve a lot with optimal effort

[Doulos Zephyr Essentials](https://www.doulos.com/zephyr/) . This training will help you maximise  the potential of Zephyr and **get project ready in record time** ðŸ˜„
